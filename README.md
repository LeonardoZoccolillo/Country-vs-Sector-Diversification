# Country-vs-Sector-Diversification
Project for my "Introduction to programming I" course, provided by the USI master in Finance. Our aim is to show which type of portfolio diversification works better: we chose ETFs from different countries and indices and performed the same analysis on them. The results are great. 

You will find two files containing the code and a pdf describing the project. The code in the files is identical, except for the ETFs chosen to perform the analysis on. The first set of ETFs comprehend the ones tracking the main indices of eighteen different States, while the second set contains ETS tracking indices containing American companies diversified by their sector. The goal of our analysis is to show which optimized portfolio, composed by the mentioned ETFs, achieves the highest Sharpe Ratio measure and cumulative returns over a period of 10 years, from 2014 to 2024. We also provide other measures and graphs to implement the analysis.
